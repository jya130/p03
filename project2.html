          <h3>Ideation and Storyboarding</h3>
          <p>At the first stage, I came up with the idea of animating the journey of a Pearl in a Bubble Tea, the ideation came from one of the snack commercial advertisement. After discussing with the team, we came up with detail characters and the appearance of each character. The team drew a rough draft storyboard of the timeline together, and separate to finish a medium-fidelity storyboard.</p>

          <h3>Modeling Static Elements</h3>
          <p>
            Since there are five scenes n the animation as discussed in the storyboard, each team member took charge of each scenes and met once a week for a progress check. I was in charge of the first scene, which is the Boba Village, where there were gingerbread houses, candy canes, wells, street lamps, trees, snow floor, and the stage. The scene contains a lot of details such as candies on the rooftop, snow on the tree, and so on, the file ended up taking too much space, and I had to separate all the elements into different files and linked them into a scene overview file for animation purpose.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8">
            <span>stage[3]</span>
            <h3>Animating</h3>
            <p>After the scenes are designed, the team came together to discuss elements that require actions and animations, which include the Main character Boba, Village King, Map, Hat, and a Milky River. In order to achieve a cute and cartoony feeling, characters are designed to be simple and rounded. Rigging is used for animation purposes. </p>
            <p>I was in charge of designing the Map. With nCloth attribution in Maya, I was able to achieve the waving effects to give the map a paper feeling. With sound effects added at the next stage, the interaction with the map seems more realistic by this design.</p>

              <span>stage[4]</span>
              <h3>Post-Animation</h3>
              <p>After the animation is done, rendering takes us a lot of time. Because of the time constraint, the quality of the rendering setting was not able to be maximized. After rendering is done, the team used Adobe PR for video editing, visual effects, and soundtracks to finalize the cartoon animation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-2">
            </div>
          </div>

        <div class="process_container animatable fadeInUp">

            <div class="col-md-8">
              <span>self-reflection</span>
              <p>
                This animation design allows me to express creativity. One of the biggest concerns regarding the process of this project is the time constrains and asset constraints. Since rendering requires both time and hardware, if changes are made after first renders, the process would require more time to complete. Having low-fidelity renders to sequence out the film to understand the lighting and camera angles is an efficient way to spot any animation problems before spending too much time on rendering for high-quality images.</p>
